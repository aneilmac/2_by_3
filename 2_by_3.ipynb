    "Even before lockdown mathematics was much maligned by parents. \n",
    "How many have thrown little Johnny's homework across the room shouting: \n",
    "\"Why did they change multiplication? This isn't how _I_ was taught it!\" \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "My coworker came to me with this problem presented to his nine-year old Johnny. I am told Johnny was found to be despairing over this one for a while:\n",
    "\n",
    "> With the numbers 1,2,3,4,5 make a 2 digit and 3 digit number (only using each number once) that gives:  \n",
    "> a) the smallest product  \n",
    "> b) the largest product\n",

    "I sympathise, I think if someone used the word \"product\" around me when I was 9 I'd run for the hills.\n",
    "\n",
    "My coworker was seeing red; as he saw it, with little guidance Johnny was expected to brute force a huge number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The perspective of the teacher, meanwhile, was that it was not about a fixed soltuion, but finding a reasonable apporach through gut-feeling. \"Anyway,\" she said, \"you have a calculator so it should be quite fast.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Something about blindly fumbling in the darkness doesn't sit well with me; it's a joyless task. Here the magician demands you perform the trick but doesn't give any hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not even sure how a nine-year old is supposed to have confidence in their solution. Are they expected to eventually give up and say \"good enough\" after enough reasonable attempts? It seems unfair. It doesn't seem a worthwhile lesson for the time-cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is easy for a computer to solve, which I'll demonstrate below. But this isn't about a computer solving the problem, it's about humans with human brains. What I intend to do is tear this problem apart, and try to derive a set of rules human beings can follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The computer's answer\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 120 total permutations in this question. Poor Johnny better sharpen his pencils!\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we can say there are 120 permutations is because at the core we're asking in how many ways can `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` be rearranged\n",
    "without duplication, which is `5!` (5 factorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this point, just image we have a list of permutations of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1 2 3 4 5  \n",
    "> 2 1 4 3 5  \n",
    "> 3 4 2 5 1  \n",
    "> ...\n",
    "\n",
    "If we introduce `x` betweem the second and third digits we now have the multiplication expression:\n",

    "> 12 x 345  \n",
    "> 21 x 435  \n",
    "> 34 x 251  \n",
    "> ...\n",
    "\n",
    "So if there are 120 permutations of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` then there must be 120 permutations of the multiplication expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a huge number for nine-year-old Johnny to work his way through. But its pretty easy for a computer, so let's get that out of the way first.\n"

    "Notice that the same digits occupy the two-digit number and three-digit number respectively, the only difference is the _local_ ordering of the two-digit number.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's pretty obvious that `12 < 21`. So it also stands to reason that that `(12 x 345) < (21 x 345)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can extrapolate this to the three digit number also:  `345 < 354 < 435 < 453 < 534 < 543`. Given `[3, 4, 5]` the smallest product will be a multiplication of 345, and the largest product will be a multiplication 543.\n",
    "\n",
    "So given a number made of the digits `[1, 2]`, and another number made of the digits `[3, 4, 5]` then the smallest possible product must be `12 x 345`, and the largest product from must be `21 x 543`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a general rule here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For the **smallest** product, the digits in a number must be sorted in **ascending** order, starting from the most significant column.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Calculating combinations\n",

    "How does this help us? Well it lets us disregard a significant number of permutations.\n",
    "In-fact there are now only 20 permutations we need to concern ourselves with now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this thought expermiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Imagine you have 5 ping-pong balls labeled with the numbers 1-5 placed in a bag. \n",
    "> If you then draw two balls at random from the bag these will form your 2-digit number.\n",

    "> \n",

    ">\n",
    "> How many unique solutions are there?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the order in which we draw from the bag does not matter here. Drawing `1` then `2` is exactly the same as drawing `2` then `1`. We are _only_ interested in the combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can easily write out all the different combinations by hand:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]\n",
    "[1, 3], [2, 4, 5]\n",
    "[1, 4], [2, 3, 5]\n",
    "[1, 5], [2, 3, 4]\n",
    "[2, 3], [1, 4, 5]\n",
    "[2, 4], [1, 3, 5]\n",
    "[2, 5], [1, 3, 4]\n",

    "[3, 5], [1, 2, 4]\n",
    "[4, 5], [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's 10 possible combinations. So that's 10 different permutations which contains the minimum products, and 10 different permutations which contain the maximum product for a total of 20 permutations in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of doing this by hand, there is an equation which tells us the total number of combinations: `n! / (r! * (n - r)!)`; \n",
    "where `n` is the number of balls, and `r` is the amount we draw from the bag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging `n=5` and `r=2` into the combination equation gives us `10`. Notice that `r` can be `2` _or_ `3`, it doesn't matter as the answer is still the same. \n",
    "If this surprises you, think of it like this: if we draw 2 balls from the bag, 3 will remain inside it. \n",
    "Likewise if we draw 3 balls from the bag, 2 will remain inside. It's all equivelent!\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of calculating all the products by hand, let's have Python do it for us."
